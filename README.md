# 01-Guessing
-- Guessing Game project for Game Technology class --
This is the first project for my Game Technology class.
It is a simple guessing game made in Python, where you try to guess a random number from 1 to 100.
You have as many tries as you need. 
The game program records how many guesses you make, and even what guess you make, and reports them back to you when you win.
